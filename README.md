## Goal of the project
The project is based on the well known Iris Dataset, with the goal to achieve an efficient classification of Iris flowers according to the 3 known Iris species: 
- Setosa 
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Based on the attributes of the flowers : 
- Length of the petal
- Petal width
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
## Content of the project
The project consists of the following steps: 
1. Dataset analysis: 
    * Distribution of the different attributes 
    * Verification of the absence of missing values
2. Visualization of the data
3. Classification of the data 
    * Using the Random Forrest algorithm
    * Using a decision tree
## Software requirements 
- Python 3.8 and higher

As well as the following Python packages and modules: 
- scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (Pyplot module)
- Seaborn
